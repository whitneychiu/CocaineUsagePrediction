# CocaineUsagePrediction
 
Drug use is a major problem affecting many people that are experiencing mental health issues, social insecure and even homelessness. As well, together with other social and demographic risk factors, multiple drug use are likely mutually implicated.

Cocaine, one of the most addictive stimulant drug, has affected all levels of society across a wide range of age. According to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) in the UK, compared to other drugs, cocaine has been used up to the age of 54. 

In this project, we aim to predict the cocaine consumption frequency with demographic data combined with other drug usage frequency. We aim to apply numerous machine learning techniques to see which model would accurately predict a person’s cocaine consumption frequency.

Final deliverable would include an interactive web page or app that enables prediction of a person’s cocaine usage.  Other extensions would be included later on when the project moves forward and ideas spawn.
